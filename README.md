# custom_math_module
The my_math module is a custom module with mathematical functions and classes designed to facilitate work on my other projects.

Contains functions pertaining to primes: primes less than N, primality tests.

Contains a vector class.

Contains functions to estimate derivatives and integrals of functions as well as estimate the solutions to ODEs of the for y'(t)=f(y,t).

Contains functions to perform statistical operations: mean, standard deviation, variance, standard error, weighted mean, percent error, fitting linear model to data, calculating residuals of a fit, chi square test, root mean square, Durbin-Watson test.
